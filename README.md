# FirstJupyterNotebook

Fork this, then clone it. Create a new jupyter notebook. Figure out how to use Pandas to answer the questions below. 
When you are finished with the analysis, commit it, and push it back to your fork.

There is a CSV in here, `museums.csv`

## Questions about the data set

- Which city or state has the most museums per capita? 
California has the most museums (but where do I compare capita)?
- Which city or state has the least museums per capita? 
Delaware has the least museums (once again how do I compare capita with no population)
